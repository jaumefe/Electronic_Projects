# Electronic_Projects
At this file, there will be included some electronic projects which could be used for home automation. Here, we can find the list of projects done until now:
* Weather Forecast Station

## Weather Forecast
It consists of a station which includes two sensors:
* SHT40-AD1B-R2: Temperature and Humidity Sensor
* DPS310: Barometric Pressure Sensor

This project only contains a board with both sensors which should be connected to a MCU by a I2C serial interface. In this case, I will be using a Raspberry Pi Pico to do the project. If you are also interested on the code, please check the following repository: https://github.com/jaumefe/Raspberry_Pico/tree/main/Weather_Forecast
